To correct the unexpected inheritance, avoid relying on inheritance in situations with conflicting specificity.

Instead, explicitly set the desired color:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

.container p {
  color: green;
}

.container p.special {
  color: blue; /* Explicitly set the color */
}
```

This way, the specificity is clear, and the `color` property is directly assigned to the `p.special` element, resolving the inheritance issue and ensuring consistent styling.
