The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

.container p {
  color: green;
}

.container p.special {
  color: inherit;
}
```

The unexpected behavior arises from the interaction between `inherit`, specificity, and the context of `.container p.special`.  While one might expect `color: inherit;` to inherit the `color` property from the parent `.container`, this does not work as expected. Instead, it inherits from the most specific selector targeting the `p` element within the `.container`, which is `.container p` (with `color: green;`)
